[Repuls.io](https://repuls.io/home) is the future of browser games.
The best free instantly accessible multiplayer first-person shooter for your browser with no sign-up or payment required!

Tired of the same run, aim, shoot gameplay that every shooter does ?! Played one, you played them all! Repuls has you riding bikes, grappling cliffs, piloting mechs and firing miniguns and plasma rifles and stomping vehicles with a giant mech! **That's** the repuls experience son!

# ⚙️ Development
You can find details about the front-end operation of the bot in [the wiki](https://github.com/pandaroux007/RepulsBot/wiki), this section is intended for developers only.

> [!NOTE]
> **Your contributions are welcome, be sure to read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first!** Even if you don't want to contribute, you can find all the details for configuring and launching the bot in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

<summary><strong>Development stage</strong></summary>

## Development goals
- [**`in progress`**] Display information on lobbies, stats, etc.
- [**`next step`**] Show game leaderboard with pagination via discord
- For authorized players, asset store of the game from discord (ft. Caracal)
- Discord 1v1s ([details here](https://discord.com/channels/603655329120518223/686216026412941429/1370057672304492554))
## In reflection (bot selection, waiting for API, etc.)
- View player information from discord (level, stats, RC count, perhaps a glimpse of the character)
- Obtaining information about an in-game clan from discord
- Moderating the live game chat (no moderation action but a warning + report to the moderators)
- ~~Passing tickets through the threads~~
## What is delegated to RCC-bot
- Making Sierra AI "live"
- Manage competitions and display eSports results

*Until the RCC-bot creator and the game's developer clearly define what should be handled by RepulsBot and what should not, this is the only thing that will not be implemented automatically.*
